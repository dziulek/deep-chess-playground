# deep-chess-playground
Experiments with different deep learning techniques to play chess.

# Setup

- Download and install Anaconda from the official website: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

- Open Anaconda Prompt and run the following command to create a virtual environment: `conda create --name <env_name>`
Replace `<env_name>` with the desired name for your environment.

- Activate the environment using the following command: `conda activate <env_name>`

- Install PyTorch. Follow the instructions at [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). 
Choose compute platform (CUDA or CPU).

- After installing PyTorch, you also need to install PyTorch Lightning: `conda install pytorch-lightning -c conda-forge`
